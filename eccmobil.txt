I think ZAP inc needs a car to transport
their employees, I think the Van is very suitable for transporting employees and needed tools and a lot of free space, price 10(because this company is still new so the cost should be kept to a minimum), comfort 5(not very comfortable like a sedan or SUV but for long trips and carrying goods the VAN is not bad), space 8 (very important to carry a lot of goods), warranty 7 (important enough so that nothing unwanted happens when the VAN is damaged)
